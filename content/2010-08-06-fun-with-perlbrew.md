## Now here's something we hope you'll really like...

I've written a lot about Perlbrew and RVM, so I won't go into any detail
about them again. (Check the [Archives][a] if you want to look for posts
with more about why I love them.) The *news* today is simply that I've
written two small things to help myself and other Perlbrew users: a
Vimscript to get the current Perl interpreter into your Vim status line and
Bash completion for Perlbrew. I am very much a novice at both Vimscript and
Bash completion, so I would be happy to receive any feedback, bug reports,
suggestions, criticisms, etc.

In any case, you can find both scripts on Github. Feel free to fork and
improve them:

+ [Bash completion for Perlbrew][b]
+ [vim-perlbrew][vp]
