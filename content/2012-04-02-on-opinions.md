## TIL

Today I learned that The Los Angeles Times built a site that enables you
[to search for contributions for and against Proposition 8][lat] by name,
employer, date or amount. There's been a great deal of buzz about this
recently because Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, [donated $1000 to
support Proposition 8][be].

This being the internet, a lot of the responses were hate (in any and every
direction) or bad puns or otherwise useless. But I only want to talk about
one common thread since I think it's a textbook, but unrecognized, case of
[derailing][derailing]. (That is, it's not in the canonical list of
derailment strategies in Derailment for Dummies.)

The response I want to talk about is "He has every right to support
Proposition 8."

## Every Right

What does "He has every right..." mean here? It could mean the literal
thing: He has a right (moral or political) to have this opinion.  But
I doubt it. Certainly in this context, nobody was suggesting we pass laws
to outlaw *the opinion* that gay people should not be allowed to marry.

The real point, I think, is in the implied continuation, "He has a right to
his opinion and therefore (<i>sic</i>?) you're somehow wrong to have
disagreed." This is pure derailing. After all, what are you likely to
respond?  "Obviously, he has a right to his opinion.  I just think he's
*wrong*..." But now --- by magic --- we're no longer arguing about
Proposition 8 or gay marriage. We're discussing people and their right to
opinions. We got derailed.

## Point?

The point is this: saying "He/I/Whoever has a right to have an opinion" is
*not* a helpful response to criticism. Criticism is (generally) an
attempt to engage. "So-and-so has a right to an opinion" is an attempt to
disengage. Better responses include reflection, argument, consideration,
discussion, etc.

Because, to bring this back to the present case, opinions *matter*. They
change people's lives. In the case of Proposition 8 (and other such laws),
they affect a vast number of people who cannot enjoy the rights and
privileges marriage brings. If the best response you can think of is "He
has a right to his opinion," please try harder. That response doesn't
affect the real conversation --- Will we or won't we give equal rights to
the people who currently lack them? --- at all. That response is merely hot
air.
