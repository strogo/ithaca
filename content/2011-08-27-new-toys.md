## Has it been that long?

I'm depressed to see that I haven't written since November of 2010. That's bad. We'll say I've been busy and move on. K? K.

## Nanoc?

Yup. I originally created this blog using [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), "a blog-aware, static site generator". I liked it just fine. But ever since using [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) to build a handful of sites, I've wanted to switch over. I've finally done it. I had thought about completely revamping the CSS, but in the end I just tweaked it slightly. I may still come back and tweak it some more.

## Differences

So what, exactly, has changed behind the scenes?

+ nanoc instead of jekyll as the site generator, as I said above. This is the biggest change.
+ Sass instead of raw CSS. I'm just beginning to experiment with this, so for the moment, it's really `.scss` files with raw CSS in them. That should change in the next couple of weeks.
+ [Redcarpet](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet) instead of [Rdiscount](https://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount) for Markdown to HTML conversion. (As an added bonus, I'm finally using [SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) to get proper punctuation.)
+ I'm no longer using [Typekit](http://typekit.com/) for fonts. That means that my semi-monthly switches to various exotic fonts is out. Instead, I'm using the [DejaVu family](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/foundry/DejaVu-Fonts) from [FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/).
+ Not to do with this site, nanoc or jekyll, but I'm using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) instead of [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com). I had a clean machine (wiped the hard drive and upgraded to Lion), so I decided to experiment. So far I like it a lot.

The [source code for this site is still on Github](https://github.com/telemachus/ithaca). Feel free to poke around, if you're curious.

## What's next?

School is back in session very soon. I would like to write more (such a clich√©, but true). I'll shoot for at least one post a month.

In terms of software projects, I'm working on a Sinatra site related to the [Washington Capitals](http://capitals.nhl.com/). Yes, that's odd, but my wife is a huge fan, and I came across a really fun idea. Also, it gives me an excuse to get to know Sinatra better. Details forthcoming.
