## The part where I'm an idiot

Yesterday, I was a jerk on the internet. Nothing very unusual really. I was
frustrated with a few things and in that state where you're mumbling and
cursing to yourself as you try to make it all work. Like many people now,
I didn't keep my grumbling to myself. I shared it on Twitter. I [complained
about a software build][darcs]. Then, I [complained about a website being
down][website]. To mix things up, I went back to [complaining about the
software build][darcs2]. Next, I moved on to [complain about a software
packaging format][vimballs]. Finally, I [unloaded on a newly-installed Vim
plugin][haskellmode].

All of this was in the space of about thirty minutes. I wasn't patient.
I didn't try to understand my problems better. I wanted things to work
immediately and to work as I thought they should. I was a jerk. As I said
above, this is nothing special. I'm often a jerk. And people often use
Twitter to dump this sort of anger and frustration now. (Other places as
well, obviously.)

## The part where I get humbled

Also yesterday I read [Thoughtbot's Thanksgiving post][tb]. I remember
thinking it was classy, and I almost tweeted about it. I didn't, and beyond
thinking briefly that it was classy, it had no further effect on me.

This morning, I woke up to see that [Erik Kow][ek] messaged me a few times
on Twitter. He maintains the website I was complaining about. He [thanked me
for letting them know the site was down][t1] and [apologized to me for the
problems][t2]. Please let that sink in. He *thanked me*, and he *apologized
to me* - emphatically apologized actually.

## The part where I try harder (aka, Don't put it on Twitter)

I remember watching adults grow frustrated and angry. Probably everyone
does. Your teacher or father or neighbor or the guy at the store is trying
to do something, and it's not working. It keeps not working, and the person
begins to mumble and curse and complain. Depending on how bad the problem
is, how much the solution matters and who the person is, they maybe even
began to yell at other people or throw things. Adults and children, not
much different really. I'd love to say that the contemporary difference is
just Twitter (or the like). Twitter makes it easy to unleash all of that
immediate annoyance on the rest of the world.

Bullshit. Seriously, bullshit. The difference is how you choose to handle
yourself. The difference is how you choose to treat other people and their
hard work. Every day I see people dump on other people's hard work on
Twitter. This software sucks. That software is a piece of a shit. Angry,
merciless, rageful bursts. I'm not sure why that's ok, but it's certainly common. It
seems especially common among programmers. Maybe they're especially
critical by training or nature, or maybe I just follow more programmers?

So, two new rules for me. First, I unfollow anyone who does that. Second,
I work much, much harder not to do it myself. Enough is enough. The people
who maintain that website, write that software, provide that Vim plugin --
they do it for free, and they let me have both the product and the source
code under permissive licences. What the hell is wrong with me?

Thank you, Eric. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have thanked me or apologized to
me. I didn't earn either.
